# 1.0.0

- Persist sign-in with trusted-context storage, refresh two minutes early, and coordinate concurrent refreshes. Network failures preserve the saved session.
- Flush pending observations before comparisons, validate the uncompressed upload batch, and reject navigation changes or incomplete samples.
- Persist the five latest review attempts per account and API environment, starting before capture, with background status polling and cached results.
- Show readable review history in the popup and Verity page. Remove raw snapshot previews/downloads and protected-value JSON displays.
- Fix Settings capture-toggle recovery and scope insufficient-sample notices to the affected finding.

- Fixed policy telemetry: use exactly the upload JSON envelope through a shared builder, rather than sending a bare snapshot. Added upload-gzip versus policy-body equality regression coverage.

- Moved scan setup, submission, progress, summary and model-confidence score into the popup Verity tab. Only the detailed report opens separately.

- Added a dedicated Settings Account tab backed by whoami, with conditional verification and free-plan actions.
- Added current-site Verity summaries and report links; preserve nested analyst findings, evidence, limitations and corrected policy URLs.
- Filtered irrelevant/social policy suggestions and added a policy selector with a manual URL option.

- Reworked onboarding forms, enforced email verification with website/recheck actions, and added a visible Verity navigation tab.
- Corrected stale 25-point threshold labels in Settings, popup, and report fallback; Settings reads the configured threshold.

- Enabled onboarding sign-in and account creation, password confirmation, website session reuse, account setup completion, and a clear guest path.

- Added Verity policy comparison through authenticated `/intel/policy/compare` and `/status`; no chat API is used.
- Added extension account/plans page, direct login, trusted website session reuse and refresh-token handling.
- Enforced non-free enabled accounts in the background service, a 15-second post-load wait, and explicit redacted-snapshot consent.
- Added policy link suggestions, up to three independent policy jobs sharing one capture, readable findings, and persistent result caching.
- Lowered new telemetry snapshot/upload eligibility to 5/100, retaining compatibility for eligible older snapshots.

## 0.9 - Updated visual theme

- Applied the new Veilance theme to the popup, onboarding, settings, and visit report.
- Replaced toolbar and interface logos with the supplied fingerprint artwork.
- Kept existing extension behavior and privacy choices.

## 0.8 - First-run setup and privacy-focused interface

- Added a Firefox-specific Manifest V3 build using a module event page rather
  than a Chromium service worker.
- Added Firefox 140+ built-in, optional data-collection permission declarations
  and runtime enforcement for telemetry; local monitoring still works when the
  permission is declined or revoked.
- Serialized main-world and isolated-world extension events to cross Firefox's
  compartment boundary without exposing object-valued event details.
- Added a dependency-free, reproducible unsigned XPI builder and Firefox test
  checklist.
- Added a four-step onboarding page that opens once on a fresh installation.
- Added an honest no-account path while account services remain unavailable.
- Added required, versioned acceptance of the linked Veilance Privacy Policy.
- Kept automatic telemetry off by default and added one explicit choice that
  enables automatic local capture, upload consent, and delayed uploads together.
- Added plain-language disclosure of uploaded identifiers, public IP address,
  redacted snapshot contents, exclusions, and non-guaranteed VLNC rewards.
- Added setup recovery from the popup and a **Review setup** action in Settings.
- Matched onboarding, the popup, reports, and Settings to the Veilance website's
  restrained navy/blue visual system, with a professional light counterpart.
- Restored the supplied Veilance logo across the interface and browser icon sizes.
- Corrected the visible snapshot threshold from 20/100 to the enforced 25/100.
- Replaced the dense Overview counters with three plain-language summaries for
  website connections, browser and storage access, and actual Shield changes.
- Moved research snapshots, payouts, and reset controls into a collapsed
  **More options** area so the everyday view stays focused.
- Added one unified activity timeline for site requests, outside services, known
  trackers, browser features, storage and permissions, and Shield changes. It has
  selectable timeframes, hover/focus/tap explanations, live updates, and a matching list.
- Added bounded local event timing with destinations, request methods, resource
  categories, browser actions, and Shield correlation without retaining URL paths or bodies.
- Replaced uneven expanding evidence panels with focused modal windows that teach
  what each category means, why it matters, what users can do, and the exact evidence.
- Added Shield correlation showing the browser action, protection method, changed
  units, protected result, and its related observed signal.
- Removed raw telemetry JSON from the privacy report and replaced it with a clear
  data-sharing status, included/excluded data lists, and optional delivery details.
- Added an explicit telemetry state model that distinguishes previewed, saved,
  queued, failed, blocked, and API-confirmed uploads.
- Added local upload receipts containing the exact transport metadata and API
  confirmation needed to explain what was sent, how it was sent, and when.
- Removed Veilance instrumentation frames from native browser exceptions so
  expected website API failures are not misreported as extension stack errors.

## 0.6.19 - Expanded default-on Shield

- Enabled Fingerprint Shield by default while preserving an explicitly saved off preference.
- Expanded the bundled Shield database from 15 to 30 rules.
- Added four Web Audio analyser protections for byte and floating-point frequency and waveform readback.
- Added session-consistent Canvas text-metric farbling for font-fingerprinting resistance.
- Added ten WebGL capability-limit rules that only cap values downward and never overstate hardware support.
- Added packaged `cap-number` and `text-metrics-farbling` strategies with strict bounded validation.
- Made Shielded activity expandable so users can inspect the protected value returned to a website; large buffers use bounded previews.

## 0.6.18 - Managed Veilance Shield rules

- Added a bundled, data-only Shield rule database with automatic checks against `VeilanceApp/Veilance-Shield-DB` every eight hours.
- Added strict rule validation, archive limits, last-known-good caching, truncation protection, manual refresh, update controls, and a visible update log.
- Added 15 initial protection rules for Canvas, WebGL, Web Audio, Navigator device characteristics, and Screen characteristics.
- Added packaged strategies for pixel/array farbling, number bucketing, number normalization, capability normalization, and string normalization.
- Kept detection independent from protection so Veilance still records supported fingerprint attempts while Shield changes the values returned to the website.
- Kept remote updates declarative: downloaded rules can select only packaged hooks and strategies and cannot execute code.

## 0.6.17 - Veilance Shield branding

- Rebranded the user-facing Protections feature as **Veilance Shield**.
- Renamed the popup navigation tab to **Shielded** and its activity panel to **Shielded activity**.
- Renamed the controls to **Fingerprint Shield** and the disabled future feature to **Tracker Shield**.
- Kept existing internal storage keys and event structures unchanged for upgrade compatibility.

## 0.6.16 - Simplified protection activity

- Simplified the popup Protections panel to show only protection status, a plain-language explanation, and the number of protections on the current page.
- Removed technical signatures, pixel counts, flow diagrams, and repeated explanatory cards from the popup.
- Stacked repeated protection events into one row per protected fingerprint surface with a running count.
- Kept Tracker Protection greyed out as a future feature.

## 0.6.15 - Protection visibility

- Added a top-level **Protections** tab beside History in the extension popup.
- Added live Canvas protection evidence showing the original local pixel signature and the protected signature delivered to the website.
- Added per-visit protection interception counts and plain-language explanations of what Veilance changed and why.
- Added clear enabled/disabled states so users can tell when Veilance is detecting only versus actively protecting Canvas output.
- Added a disabled Tracker Protection preview in the Protections tab for the planned future feature.
- Kept fingerprint protection off by default and added a direct link from the popup to protection settings.

## 0.6.14

- Added a new **Protections** settings tab.
- Added **Fingerprint Protection (Beta)**, disabled by default. The first protection randomizes Canvas 2D readback and canvas exports to reduce stable canvas fingerprinting across navigations.
- Added a disabled **Tracker Protection** control as a preview of a future blocking feature.
- Added the generated contributor UUID to Settings with a direct link to `https://veilance.org/leaderboard?uuid=<UUID>`.
- Fingerprint protection is dynamically registered in the page MAIN world at `document_start` when enabled and unregistered when disabled.

## What changed in v0.6.13

* Queued, uploading, and failed snapshots are protected from local retention
  pruning so pending telemetry is not lost when more than 20 snapshots exist
* Queue pressure triggers an immediate consented upload attempt, while failed
  records remain stored for their next retry
* Enabling automatic snapshot capture now requires acknowledging that complex
  pages or several tabs loading together may experience additional latency
* The popup disables manual snapshot capture while automatic capture is on and
  explains how to restore the manual control

## What changed in v0.6.11

* Every live Overview counter now shows a clear **Typical** or **High** volume
  label
* Numeric cutoff lines are kept out of the popup so the colored **Typical** and
  **High** states remain the focus
* Activity cards now focus on concise colored **Typical** and **High** states
* Sensitive status text identifies the primary behavior and links directly to
  the finding details
* Finding totals are explicitly labeled, and important reference text has
  stronger contrast and larger type
* The snapshot interest score is now a full-width meter with a clear ready
  state instead of a cramped severity-tinted box
* The Overview notes that counts accumulate during longer visits

## What changed in v0.6.10

* One `VEILANCE_USE_PRODUCTION_API` constant now switches both telemetry
  requests from the development API to `https://api.veilance.org`
* Immediately before each upload operation, Veilance asks that same API for the
  connection address it observes and sends the validated IPv4 or IPv6 literal
  as `ip_address`
* IP resolution fails closed: a failed or malformed lookup leaves snapshots
  queued for retry instead of sending `127.0.0.1`, an empty value, or a guessed
  address
* Veilance does not use WebRTC/STUN or a third-party IP lookup service

## What changed in v0.6.9

* Automatic local snapshot capture is available as a separate Settings opt-in
  and remains off by default
* When enabled, Veilance saves one snapshot per public-site visit as soon as
  the existing interest score reaches 25/100
* Capture retries transient content-script failures up to three times and does
  not run in Incognito or on private, local, internal, or unsupported pages
* Automatic capture never grants upload consent; automatic uploading remains a
  separate control

## What changed in v0.6.8

* Unsupported browser-internal, extension, local-file, and non-web pages now
  receive a dedicated friendly popup instead of an empty monitoring dashboard
* The page clearly confirms that nothing was collected and provides quick
  actions to check again or open Settings

## What changed in v0.6.7

* `domain_name` now contains the complete normalized website hostname,
  including subdomains, with no scheme, port, path, query, or fragment
* Upload batches are separated by exact hostname so the request field always
  describes every snapshot in its gzip payload

## What changed in v0.6.6

* **Upload now** queues every eligible local, failed, or privacy-delayed
  snapshot and immediately starts the multipart request
* Users can opt into automatic uploads; existing eligible snapshots and future
  snapshots are queued without requiring a separate Queue button
* Automatic uploads retain the randomized 5–15 minute privacy delay, while
  **Upload now** explicitly bypasses it
* The stable pseudonymous identifier is available as the multipart `client_id`
  field and remains inside the compressed envelope as `contributorId`
* Each request also includes the generated public Solana address as
  `wallet_address` and the registrable website domain as `domain_name`; the
  private wallet key is never uploaded
* Upload batches are separated by registrable domain, so `domain_name` never
  represents a mixture of unrelated sites

## What changed in v0.6.5

* Telemetry uploads use multipart fields: `client_id` and `ip_address` are text
  fields, while `telemetry` is a raw gzip file with MIME type
  `application/gzip`
* The browser creates the multipart boundary automatically; gzip data is never
  converted to Base64 or placed in JSON
* Uploading targets the configured development endpoint and remains gated by
  separate user consent
* A snapshot is marked uploaded only when the API returns HTTP success and
  `output.ok` is exactly `true`; JSON error reports remain queued for retry

## What changed in v0.6.0

* User-triggered snapshots combine host-level network observations, tracker
  matches, browser API names/actions and counts, page/security counts, and an
  inert structural HTML representation
* A deterministic 0–100 interest score prevents routine activity from being
  snapshotted: high findings add 25 points, medium findings add 10, low findings
  add 2, and repeated allowed API activity can add 5–10 points
* HTML redaction removes all page text, form values, URL paths and searches,
  event handlers, arbitrary attributes, inline script source, comments, styles,
  private network origins, and other value-bearing content
* External resource URLs are reduced to public origins and stored only in
  non-executable `data-veilance-*` attributes
* Inline scripts contribute only coarse capability hints such as Canvas,
  WebGL, WebGPU, audio, font, navigator, advertising, or anti-blocking behavior
* DOM ids, classes, and attribute names contribute only coarse advertising,
  consent, tracking, or anti-blocking marker counts; their original values are
  never retained
* The final background validator rejects a snapshot if it contains raw text,
  executable URL attributes, URL paths/searches, private hosts, or forbidden
  identity/value fields
* Remote signal reduction uses an explicit built-in indicator/API/action
  allowlist, so a page cannot place arbitrary strings in uploadable signal
  fields by dispatching a lookalike event
* The SQLite snapshot vault is separate from visit history and retains the 20
  newest snapshots
* Settings is divided into Tracker database, Detection, Snapshots, Wallet, and
  Local data tabs; the snapshot tab provides review, redacted-HTML
  inspection, downloads, deletion, queue status, retry errors, and clear-all controls
* System, light, and dark appearance preferences are shared by the popup and
  Settings and saved in extension-local storage
* A random 256-bit telemetry client id is created on first startup and retained
  in extension-local storage independently of upload consent. It is never the
  Solana wallet address and precise local capture time and upload state are
  excluded from the transmitted payload
* The client id survives browser restarts and extension updates. Veilance
  rotates it when the detected browser family, operating system, or CPU
  architecture changes; routine browser version updates do not rotate it
* Uploads require both the compile-time build gate and separate user consent;
  users can upload immediately, queue for later, or enable automatic queueing
* Queued snapshots batch after a randomized 5–15 minute delay and retry with
  jittered 1 minute, 5 minute, 15 minute, 1 hour, and 4 hour backoff
* Upload batches are capped at 20 observations and approximately 2 MiB before
  gzip compression
* Incognito, localhost, private IP, `.local`, `.internal`, `.lan`, and other
  browser-local targets cannot produce uploadable snapshots

## v0.5.0 tracker database updates

* The current `veilance-json-trackers/*` database snapshot is bundled and
  enabled on first install
* Automatic data-only updates come from
  `VeilanceApp/Veilance-Tracker-DB` every eight hours (three checks per day while
  the browser is available)
* Separate Settings controls disable tracker matching or automatic updates;
  manual update checks remain available
* Settings retains the latest 50 update results with timestamps, revisions,
  change counts, validation skips, warnings, and errors
* Updates are downloaded as a gzip-compressed TAR archive, bounded by size,
  restricted to JSON inside `veilance-json-trackers`, and validated before the
  active database is replaced
* Managed tracker IDs are derived from repository paths, so records owned by the
  same organization remain distinct
* Host-indexed evaluation avoids scanning the entire tracker database on every
  network request

## v0.4.2 canvas compatibility fix

* Veilance observes access to canvas readback methods, then returns the original
  browser method before the website invokes it, keeping Veilance off the native
  diagnostic call stack
* `getImageData()`, `toDataURL()`, and `toBlob()` activity remains observable
* Veilance does not force `willReadFrequently`, change Pixlr's canvas backend,
  or hide the diagnostic from the website's own developer console

## v0.4.1 WebGPU compatibility fix

* Windows WebGPU adapter requests no longer forward the `powerPreference` hint
  that Chromium currently ignores and warns about
* All other current and future adapter options pass through unchanged
* WebGPU adapter requests are still recorded as privacy-relevant activity

## v0.4.0 Veilance JSON tracker support

* Veilance JSON tracker objects with `name`, `category`, `website_url`,
  `organization`, `domains`, and `filters`
* Host-anchored filter parsing for patterns such as `||tracker.example^$3p`
* First-/third-party, common resource-type, and `domain=` filter constraints
* Visible warnings for unsupported path, cosmetic, regular-expression,
  redirect, and exception filters
* `trackers` and `rules` JSON array wrappers in addition to `indicators`
* A copyable Veilance JSON template and import-ready Platform161 example

## v0.3.0 indicator expansion

* New cookie and Storage Access API observation
* New browser, platform, CPU, memory, language, plugin, and client-hint signals
* New screen, time zone, locale, font, CSS media-query, performance, WebGPU,
  network-information, and media-capability signals
* New connected-device, sensor, credential, file-system, speech, and advertising
  privacy API signals
* New combined findings for broad fingerprint profiles and sensitive local API
  use
* Built-in source ids are visible next to indicator names in Settings
* Three-step custom-rule guidance, copyable templates, and a downloadable
  starter pack in Settings
* Importable starter examples under `indicator-examples/`
