# Veilance Browser Extension v0.8 for Firefox

Veilance is a local-first browser privacy observability extension. It shows what
a website requests from browser APIs and which network hosts it contacts while
the page is open. Observations describe behavior, not intent: a finding does not
automatically mean a website is malicious.

Veilance supports explicit local telemetry snapshots. A user can capture the
current public website from the popup or separately opt into automatic local
capture once observed behavior reaches the 25/100 interest threshold. The
resulting evidence and inert redacted HTML can be reviewed, downloaded, or
deleted in Settings. Snapshot uploads require their own explicit consent and
can run immediately, through the privacy-delayed queue, or automatically. They
send raw gzip files through the configured multipart API. Accepted contributions
may receive VLNC at the browser's locally generated public Solana address;
eligibility and payout amount are determined by the service and an upload does
not guarantee payment. The separate payout dashboard remains disabled in this
release.

## Existing local-first capabilities

* One stable visit session per top-level navigation
* Redirects update the same visit instead of resetting its data
* Start, page-load-complete, update, and end timestamps
* SQLite-backed history for the latest 20 visits
* Full history detail for requests, hosts, browser API calls, page counts, findings,

## Test in Firefox

This build targets Firefox 140 or newer. It uses a Firefox Manifest V3 event
page and Firefox's built-in data-collection permission for optional telemetry.

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Select **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select either the unsigned `.xpi` release, or extract the source ZIP and
   select its `manifest.json`.
4. Pin Veilance to the toolbar.
5. Reload any sites that were already open so document-start indicators can
   initialize.

A temporary extension is removed when Firefox restarts. Permanent installation
requires a Mozilla-signed XPI. See `FIREFOX_TESTING.md` for a focused smoke-test
checklist.

## First-run setup

On a fresh installation, Veilance opens a four-step onboarding page. It:

* Explains the local privacy monitor and Fingerprint Shield
* Offers the working no-account path and identifies account sign-in as coming
  later
* Requires acceptance of the linked Veilance Privacy Policy
* Leaves automatic telemetry off unless the user explicitly enables it
* Explains the redacted upload contents, exclusions, randomized 5–15 minute
  delay, local payout wallet, and non-guaranteed VLNC reward review

Selecting **Enable automatic telemetry** turns on automatic local capture,
upload consent, and automatic queueing together. Selecting the local-only path
leaves those settings off on first run. The completed choice is stored locally,
and **Review setup** in Settings can reopen the flow. An incomplete setup also
appears as a reminder in the popup.

## Use the popup

### Overview

The Overview tab shows the active website, a plain-language assessment, and three
short explanations: website connections, browser and storage access, and what
Fingerprint Shield actually changed. Observed activity is explicitly separated
from blocked or changed activity. Research snapshots, payouts, and reset controls
remain available under **More options** without crowding the everyday view.

Select **Open the privacy report** for one unified website activity timeline.
It places site requests, outside services, tracker matches, browser features,
storage and permission access, and Shield changes on the same visit clock.
One-, five-, and fifteen-minute timeframes and the full visit are available, and
an optional live-update switch refreshes an active visit every 1.5 seconds. Every
timeline mark exposes the exact evidence and plain-language context on hover,
focus, or tap; the same activity is also available as a list. Network entries
show the destination, request method, and resource category without inspecting
request bodies, response bodies, URL paths, or query strings.

Evidence topics open in focused modal windows with a definition, an explanation
of why the category matters, practical next steps, and the exact local records.
The Shield section connects supported browser observations to the protection
rule, what was changed, and the protected answer returned to the website. The
Data sharing section distinguishes local, queued, failed, and accepted snapshots
without exposing a raw telemetry dump. Request timing, findings, and Shield
explanations are never added to the telemetry snapshot.

The compact **Wallet & payouts** button opens the dedicated Settings
tab containing the Solana address, backup controls, and payout status.

Use the appearance button in the popup to switch directly between light and
dark mode. Settings also provides **System**, **Light**, and **Dark** options.

### History

The History tab shows the latest 20 visits. Select a visit to review:

* Observation start, page-load completion, end, and duration
* First-party and third-party request totals
* Every retained host and resource-type count
* Known service matches
* Every enabled browser API signal, its count, and first/last observation time
* Page structure and storage counts
* Top-level response status and selected security-header presence
* All built-in and imported findings

“Complete” refers to Veilance's complete observation record for the visit. It
does not include page content, form values, exact URLs, or other excluded
sensitive data.

### Save a telemetry snapshot

While viewing a public HTTP(S) website, Veilance scores observed actions from 0
to 100. **Save snapshot** becomes available at 25/100. Visits below that
threshold are treated as routine and cannot be snapshotted. The capture is
manual unless **Save eligible snapshots automatically** is enabled in Settings.
Automatic capture remains off by default and saves at most one local snapshot
per eligible visit. Open **Settings → Telemetry** to:

* Review the raw telemetry fields and the redacted HTML as inert text
* Inspect third-party resource origins, inline-script capability hints, and
  advertising, consent, tracking, or anti-blocking structural markers
* Download the complete local record as JSON or the redacted HTML as `.txt`
* Delete one snapshot or clear the vault without clearing visit history
* Opt into automatic local capture independently of any upload permission
* Opt into uploads, then upload immediately, queue selected snapshots for later,
  or enable automatic upload for future eligible snapshots

The snapshot provides evidence for an analyst or backend classifier. It does
not label a site as malicious and does not upload the locally generated
`findings` or severity interpretations.

## Indicator settings

Open the popup and select **Settings**. Each built-in indicator can be enabled
or disabled separately. A change affects new observations immediately; it does
not rewrite existing history.

Veilance observes enabled signals independently of protection. Fingerprint
Shield modifies supported fingerprint values before a website receives them.
It is enabled by default; users can turn it off at any time without disabling
detection.

## Tracker database updates

Settings shows the managed tracker database separately from user-imported
custom rules. **Enable tracker matching** controls matching without deleting the
local database. **Automatic updates** controls the eight-hour alarm. **Check
now** always remains available for a manual refresh.

Each successful update is validated completely before it replaces the last
known-good database. A failed download or invalid archive leaves the active
tracker set unchanged and adds the error to the visible update log. Tracker
updates are declarative JSON and cannot execute code.

## Veilance Shield database updates

The Fingerprint Shield uses a bundled offline starter pack and validated
data-only updates from `VeilanceApp/Veilance-Shield-DB`. **Enable downloaded
Shield rules** controls whether the local database may activate, **Automatic
updates** controls the eight-hour alarm, and **Check now** performs a manual
refresh. The separate Fingerprint Shield master switch is on by default and
preserves an explicitly saved off preference.

Each rule matches a supported indicator/API/action hook and selects a packaged
strategy such as pixel farbling, numeric bucketing, capability capping, text
metric farbling, or value normalization.
Remote rules cannot contain or execute JavaScript. A new browser API hook or a
new strategy still requires an extension release; existing hooks and strategy
parameters can be maintained entirely through the Shield DB.

Veilance validates the complete candidate set before replacement. An empty,
invalid, or unexpectedly truncated update leaves the last known good rules in
place and records the failure in Settings. Current coverage includes Canvas
pixels and text metrics, WebGL pixels and capability limits, Web Audio buffers
and analyser output, Navigator device characteristics, and Screen characteristics.

The popup's **Shielded** tab groups protected activity by rule. Each item can be
expanded to inspect what the website received. Scalar returns are shown exactly;
large Canvas, WebGL, and audio buffers show their type, full length, and a bounded
sample so the popup does not retain or render megabytes of page data.

## Load indicators from a folder

Select **Choose folder** in Settings, then choose a directory that
contains JSON files. The browser grants one-time read access to the selected
files. Veilance does not retain a directory handle and does not scan folders in
the background.

Imported indicators are data-only rules. They cannot contain or execute
JavaScript. A file may contain one object, an array, or an object with an
`indicators`, `trackers`, or `rules` array.

For the easiest start:

1. Select **Download starter file** in Settings.
2. Put the downloaded JSON file in its own folder.
3. Edit the examples or add another `.json` file.
4. Select **Choose folder** and choose that folder.

Use `indicatorId` to match every retained event from a built-in source. Source
ids are shown next to each event-based indicator in Settings. Keep that built-in
indicator enabled. For a narrower rule, use the exact case-sensitive `api` and
`action` strings shown in a visit's **Technical details**.

Signal example:

```json
{
  "id": "repeated-font-probing",
  "name": "Repeated font probing",
  "category": "Fingerprinting",
  "description": "Font-related signals appeared at least ten times.",
  "severity": "medium",
  "match": {
    "indicatorId": "font-probing",
    "minCount": 10
  }
}
```

Combined example:

```json
{
  "id": "broad-fingerprint-profile",
  "name": "Broad fingerprint profile",
  "description": "Navigator, screen, and font signals appeared together.",
  "severity": "medium",
  "match": {
    "mode": "all",
    "signals": [
      { "indicatorId": "navigator-characteristics" },
      { "indicatorId": "screen-characteristics" },
      { "indicatorId": "font-probing" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Host example:

```json
{
  "id": "example-host",
  "name": "Example host contacted",
  "description": "A matching host was contacted.",
  "severity": "low",
  "match": {
    "hosts": ["metrics.example"]
  }
}
```

Veilance JSON tracker example:

```json
{
  "format": "veilance-json",
  "name": "Platform161",
  "category": "advertising",
  "website_url": "https://platform161.com/",
  "organization": "platform161",
  "domains": [
    "creative-serving.com",
    "p161.net"
  ],
  "filters": [
    "||ads.creative-serving.com^$3p",
    "||p161.net^$3p"
  ]
}
```

Veilance JSON supports host-anchored rules, first-/third-party options, common
resource types, and `domain=` page constraints. Veilance warns and skips filters
that require URL paths, cosmetic matching, regular expressions, redirects, or
exception semantics because history intentionally retains host-level request
data rather than full URLs. Keep the built-in `network-requests` indicator
enabled while using tracker rules.

`mode` may be `any` or `all`. A signal matcher may contain `indicatorId`,
`kind`, `api`, `action`, and `minCount`. Host rules use `hosts` or
`hostSuffix`. See `indicator-examples/` for import-ready rules and the complete
authoring guide.

## Solana wallet

On first startup, Veilance asks the browser's Web Crypto implementation to
generate an Ed25519 keypair. The Solana address and 64-byte secret key are
derived locally. The private key is returned to a page only after the user
explicitly confirms an export in Settings.

Export options include:

* Copying the standard Base58 private key
* Downloading the standard 64-byte Solana keypair array

Important security boundary:

* The generated public address is sent as `wallet_address` only after telemetry
  upload consent is enabled.
* The 64-byte secret key and its Base58 private-key form never leave the browser
  through Veilance telemetry.
* The keypair is stored in `chrome.storage.local` for the extension profile.
* It is not encrypted with a separate user passphrase in this release.
* A person or process with access to the browser profile or extension storage
  may be able to recover it.
* Removing extension data or losing the browser profile can remove the only
  local copy. Back up the key before funding the wallet.
* Payouts are not active in v0.6.0.

## SQLite history storage

Veilance uses the official SQLite WebAssembly runtime bundled under
`vendor/sqlite/`. Visit data is inserted and queried through SQLite. The SQLite
database bytes are serialized into extension-local storage so Manifest V3
service-worker restarts do not lose history.

The `visits` table stores one row per visit and prunes itself to the most recent
20 rows. The separate `telemetry_snapshots` table stores no more than 20
interest-qualified manual or automatic snapshots, their local queue state, and
the redacted payload.
Derived summary columns keep both lists inexpensive while the complete local
records remain available for review.

No remote executable code is loaded. The bundled SQLite runtime is version
3.53.0 from the official `sqlite/sqlite-wasm` project.

## Snapshot upload API contract

This build uses one constant for its complete Veilance API origin:

```javascript
export const VEILANCE_USE_PRODUCTION_API = false;
export const VEILANCE_DEVELOPMENT_API_ORIGIN = "http://10.0.10.211:5132";
export const VEILANCE_PRODUCTION_API_ORIGIN = "https://api.veilance.org";
export const VEILANCE_API_ORIGIN = VEILANCE_USE_PRODUCTION_API
  ? VEILANCE_PRODUCTION_API_ORIGIN
  : VEILANCE_DEVELOPMENT_API_ORIGIN;

export const TELEMETRY_UPLOAD_ENABLED = true;
export const TELEMETRY_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT = `${VEILANCE_API_ORIGIN}/api/v1/telemetry/upload`;
export const TELEMETRY_IP_ADDRESS_ENDPOINT = `${VEILANCE_API_ORIGIN}/api/v1/telemetry/ip`;
export const TELEMETRY_UPLOAD_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP = !VEILANCE_USE_PRODUCTION_API;
```

Set `VEILANCE_USE_PRODUCTION_API` to `true` for a production build. Both the IP
lookup and upload then use `https://api.veilance.org`, and insecure HTTP is
disabled automatically. The HTTP exception exists only for the private
development endpoint. The user must still enable **Allow pseudonymous snapshot
uploads** in Settings. They can then upload immediately, queue with a randomized
privacy delay, or opt into automatic queueing. Unscored legacy records and
visits below 25/100 cannot be queued. Enabling the build gate alone never uploads
existing or future snapshots.

Immediately before an upload operation, the extension sends a credential-free
`GET /api/v1/telemetry/ip` request to the selected API origin. The expected
response uses the same report envelope as the upload API:

```json
{
  "error": {},
  "metadata": { "request_id": "req-example" },
  "output": { "ip_address": "203.0.113.42" }
}
```

The extension accepts a valid IPv4 or IPv6 literal and uses it for every domain
batch in that upload operation. It does not persist the address. A non-2xx
response, invalid JSON, or malformed address fails the upload safely and leaves
the snapshots eligible for the normal retry schedule.

The request is equivalent to:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F 'client_id=stable-random-256-bit-client-id' \
  -F 'wallet_address=generated-public-solana-address' \
  -F 'domain_name=collector.shop.example.co.uk' \
  -F 'ip_address=203.0.113.42' \
  -F 'telemetry=@telemetry.bin;type=application/gzip' \
  http://10.0.10.211:5132/api/v1/telemetry/upload
```

The API needs a small first-party lookup route. In the Flask blueprint shown by
the upload API, its direct form is:

```python
@veilance_v1.route("/telemetry/ip", methods=["GET"])
def telemetry_ip():
    return settings.build_json_report({"ip_address": request.remote_addr})
```

If production is behind a reverse proxy, configure Flask/Werkzeug to trust the
exact known proxy hop count so `request.remote_addr` represents the originating
client. Do not accept an arbitrary internet-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` value.
The upload service should also use its own connection-derived address as the
authoritative stored IP. The multipart `ip_address` field is useful for
association and diagnostics, but like every client-supplied field it can be
spoofed and must not be used for authentication or abuse controls.

`domain_name` is the complete normalized hostname, including subdomains. For a
page at `https://collector.shop.example.co.uk/private?q=secret`, the field is
`collector.shop.example.co.uk`; the scheme, port, path, query, and fragment are
not included. Batches are separated by that hostname. The `telemetry` file
contains raw gzip bytes. After decompression, its JSON is:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "veilance.telemetry-snapshot-batch.v1",
  "batchId": "random-uuid",
  "contributorId": "stable-random-256-bit-client-id",
  "observations": [
    {
      "schemaVersion": "veilance.telemetry-snapshot.v2",
      "eventId": "idempotent-event-id",
      "site": { "hostname": "example.com", "https": true },
      "observation": { "durationSeconds": 42, "totalRequests": 137 },
      "thirdPartyHosts": [],
      "trackers": [],
      "signals": [],
      "page": {},
      "security": {},
      "interest": {
        "score": 25,
        "level": "interesting",
        "minimumScore": 25,
        "eligible": true,
        "reasons": [{ "id": "geolocation", "severity": "high", "points": 25 }]
      },
      "redactedDocument": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

The API can use `domain_name` for basic hostname-level deduplication and should
use each observation's `eventId` for exact idempotency. Local `snapshotId`, exact
capture time, queue state, retry errors, and private wallet material stay in
SQLite or extension-local settings. The public wallet address is transmitted in
the multipart request only.

### Pseudonymous telemetry client identity

Veilance creates the telemetry client id during background initialization, even
when snapshot uploading is disabled. The id is 32 bytes from the browser's
cryptographically secure random generator and is stored in
`chrome.storage.local`, so the same browser profile keeps the same id across
restarts and extension upgrades.

The extension also stores a SHA-256 hash of a coarse local environment record:
browser family, operating system, CPU architecture, and Native Client
architecture. The raw environment fields and their hash are never added to an
upload. If the hash changes, Veilance replaces the old id with a new unrelated
random id. Browser version numbers, hardware serial numbers, fonts, screen
properties, and other fingerprinting inputs are deliberately excluded. A new
browser profile or reinstall creates a new id because extension-local storage
does not carry over. Existing `veilanceTelemetryContributorIdV1` values are
migrated without changing the user's current pseudonymous identity.

## Privacy boundary

Routine visit history does not retain:

* Full URL paths, query strings, or fragments
* Page text or HTML
* Form values or keystrokes
* Cookie names or values
* Storage keys or values
* Clipboard contents
* Camera or microphone data
* Geolocation coordinates
* Browser, hardware, screen, network, locale, time-zone, or font values read by
  instrumented fingerprint indicators
* Peripheral names, ids, or sensor readings
* Credential, passkey, challenge, or authenticator response data
* Local file names or contents
* Speech audio, recognized text, or installed voice details
* Advertising topics, auction configuration, or Shared Storage keys and values
* Passwords, authentication tokens, or authorization headers

History retains the safe origin/hostname, aggregate counts, approved signal
metadata, and timing needed to explain what happened during the visit.

A telemetry snapshot additionally retains a redacted HTML
structure. It contains standard tag names, fixed redaction placeholders,
allowlisted non-value attributes, public resource origins in inert
`data-veilance-*` attributes, and coarse evidence counters. It never contains
page text, inline script source, arbitrary id/class values, live `src`/`href`
attributes, form values or field attributes, cookie/storage contents, URL
paths/searches, or private host origins.

The server-observed IP lookup occurs only when an opted-in upload actually
starts. The returned address is placed in that multipart request and is not
written into visit history, snapshot payloads, or extension storage.

## Permissions

### `webRequest`

Observes request metadata and response-header names. Veilance does not block,
redirect, or modify traffic.

### `webNavigation`

Creates one visit lifecycle per top-level navigation and records when the page
commits and completes loading. This prevents redirects and subrequests from
resetting the visit.

### `storage`

Keeps active visit state, indicator settings, the serialized SQLite database,
custom indicator definitions, managed tracker and Shield definitions, their
update logs, the automatic-capture preference, local snapshot upload consent, the
automatic-upload preference, the stable pseudonymous telemetry client identity,
the shared appearance preference, onboarding completion and privacy-policy
acceptance metadata, and local wallet material.

### `unlimitedStorage`

Allows the full managed tracker and Shield databases and future database growth
to remain in extension-local storage without displacing visit history or user
rules.

### `alarms`

Schedules tracker, detection, and Shield database checks every eight hours. In
an upload-enabled build, it also wakes privacy-delayed queued snapshot batches
and retries. If the
browser is closed or the extension event page is inactive, Firefox delivers the
missed alarm when the extension next runs.

### HTTP and HTTPS host access

Required to observe browser API use and request metadata on sites the user
visits, and to call the selected first-party Veilance telemetry API.
Browser-internal and other extension pages remain outside the observation
boundary.

## Test locally

From the extension directory:

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run build:firefox
```

The Firefox build command creates an unsigned XPI in `web-ext-artifacts/`.

To rebuild the bundled tracker snapshot from a sibling checkout of
`Veilance-Tracker-DB`:

```bash
npm run build:trackers
```

To rebuild the bundled Shield snapshot from a sibling checkout of
`Veilance-Shield-DB`:

```bash
npm run build:shields
```

To exercise browser APIs manually:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/test-pages/privacy-demo.html`, trigger the test
controls, and inspect the Live and History tabs.

## Known limitations

* Firefox 140 or newer only; this package is the Firefox-specific build
* Top-level frames only; embedded-frame API calls are not instrumented
* Main-world wrappers can be detected, bypassed, or changed by a hostile page
* Shield rules can configure only hooks and strategies packaged in the installed
  extension; new browser surfaces still require an extension release
* Fingerprint protection can affect specialized graphics, audio, font-measurement,
  or responsive applications; it is a default-on beta that can be disabled in Settings
* Browser caching may prevent some requests from appearing through
  `webRequest`
* Third-party classification uses a compact suffix list rather than the full
  Public Suffix List
* Detection is heuristic; legitimate application behavior can trigger findings
* Custom rules evaluate retained signals and hosts, so their required built-in
  data source must remain enabled
* Telemetry snapshot uploads remain gated by explicit consent; wallet payouts
  are disabled by the build flag

## Third-party runtime

SQLite WebAssembly notices and provenance are documented in
`vendor/sqlite/README.md`. Veilance's own source remains under the repository
license in `LICENSE`.
